            <b>Innovative Instrumentation Incorporated</b> operated from 1987
            to 2007 providing non-destructive magnetic characterization equipment
            for the magnetic recording industry. From the beginning, the company's
            philosophy was to build unique equipment whose robust and adjustment
            free operation provided reliable and accurate results independent of
            the operator's skill level. The first product was a magneto-optic
            magnetometer (MOM) for rapid determination of the loop shape and
            coercivity of thin film media. At the time, this was the only
            commercial MOM available for hard magnetic films.
          </p>
          <p>
            After several years, as the industry progressed towards the use of
            MR heads, the MrT product became an increasingly important number.
            Innovative Instrumentation Inc. introduced an entirely new instrument,
            the remanent moment magnetometer (<a href="rmm.html"><b>RMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>), \
            which could map the remanent properties (MrT, Hcr, S') around a disk.
            This instrument became the major magnetic characterization tool for a
            number of manufacturers. It was subsequently modified to make similar
            measurements on the permanent magnet layer on MR head wafers and was
            used widely by the head industry where it was known as the
            <a href="xyrmm.html"><b>XY-RMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the period 1997-1998, three new pieces of equipment were
            introduced. <a href="supermom.html"><b>SUPER-MOM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>,
            the quintessential magneto-optic looper, was a totally automated
            apparatus which simultaneously measured both sides of a disk in fields
            of 6 kOe. It could be loaded with up to three cassettes and could sort
            according to Hc values with a throughput of 1500 disks/hr. The
            vibrating large sample magnetometer, <a href="vlsm.html"><b>VLSM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>,
            was the largest commercial VSM and could measure samples up to six
            inches in diameter in fields up to 2.0 kOe. Lastly, the orientation
            ratio magnetometer,  <a href="orm.html"><b>ORM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>,
            was an entirely new <a href="rmm.html"><b>RMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>
            which could measure the remanent properties in any direction on a disk
            and map the ratio of the properties in the circumferential direction
            to their corresponding values in an arbitrary direction. It handled
            sizes to 27mm and smaller and could the measure the time dependence
            of Hcr. It became the industry-wide accepted tool for measuring the
            orientation ratio in longitudinal media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, in response to industry needs for quicker, more extensive,
            and more automated measurements, a new instrument, the
            <a href="fastrmm.html"><b><i>FAST</i>RMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>,
            was introduced in the summer of 1999. This was a cassette loaded tool,
            as much as 50 times faster then the
            <a href="rmm.html"><b>RMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup>,
            for fast accurate production control of thin film media. It was also a
            valuable tool for accurate & quick determination of the time dependence
            of Hcr.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2006, again reflecting the latest direction of the recording
            industry, a new tool for characterizing the remanent magnetic
            properties of perpendicular media, the
            <a href="prmm/prmm.html"><b>PRMM</b></a><sup>TM</sup> was introduced.
            This was the only instrument capable of measuring, in non-destructive
            fashion, the remanent magnetic properties, in particular Mrt, of such
            media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Innovative Instrumentation Inc. was dedicated to finding innovative
            and unique solutions to the measurement problems encountered in the
            magnetics industry. The various pieces of our equipment were all
            responses to problems presented to us by different customers. Each
            new problem was a challenge which invigorated us and led us to create
            additional products. Our research and manufacturing facility was
            located in Horsham, Pennsylvania, about 25 miles north of Philadelphia. Changes in the recording industry, principally a contraction in the number of manufacturers, made it no longer viable for III to remain in business.
